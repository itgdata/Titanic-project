# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

In this Kaggle project I predicted survival on the Titanic and got familiar with ML basics.

In this challenge, I was be asked you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
